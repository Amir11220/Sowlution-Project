# Sowlution-Project
in order to start this project, you have to:
1-open the terminal
2-type: cd searchh-app
3- npm start
4-Also run in the terminal: npx create-react-app search 

Note: Please note that the App.jsx is not being able to call the Search.jsx function, I honestly didn't figure out how to solve it and unfortunately I cannot use any AI tool to address the error. Hope you check out my project though!
